# LED Gesture Control using Python

![Project Demo](images/image1.png)  
*A demonstration of the LED gesture control system in action.*

## 📌 Overview
This project uses **Python** and **MediaPipe** to control an LED with hand gestures. It runs on **Python 3.7** and detects specific gestures to turn the LED **ON** and **OFF**.

## 🚀 Features
- Detects hand gestures using **MediaPipe**.
- Switches an LED **ON** and **OFF** based on predefined gestures.
- Runs on **Python 3.7** with minimal dependencies.
- Can be extended for more complex gesture-based controls.
